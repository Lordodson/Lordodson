Hello, I'm Cody, I'm a computer science student at Full Sail University and a TD Probe Associate Technician at Micron Tech. Inc.
This is a repository for my old/new projects and labs.
I work with a multitude of languages. I mostly upload in C#/C++/Python
I keep my projects private, please ask if you'd like to view projects.
Thanks for visiting!
